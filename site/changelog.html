<h1>GoJS Change Log</h1>
<p id="ver"></p>

<p>
  We maintain a <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/GoJS">GitHub Repository</a>,
  which you can star to follow version updates.
  We also notify of changes on <a href="https://twitter.com/NorthwoodsGo">Twitter</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="2.2">GoJS 2.2</h2>

<p>
  GoJS 2.2 introduces a number of properties and methods for convenience and to improve customization.
  GoJS 2.2 also includes new methods for constructing objects, and enhances <a href="intro/typings.html">TypeScript typings support</a>.
</p>
<p>
  GoJS 2.2 also includes several performance enhancements when drawing large graphs, reduced memory usage,
  and more efficient replacing or merging of item Arrays.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the samples and written documentation have been upgraded to use more modern JavaScript: <code>class</code>es,
  arrow functions, <code>const</code> and <code>let</code>, so the samples and documentation might no longer be viewable
  using old browsers such as Internet Explorer 11 or some old Android browsers.
  The library and the extensions continue to target ES5 (ES2012), so that apps using the library can still work on IE11.
</p>

<h3>Method Chaining and New Ways to Build Objects</h3>

<p>
  In GoJS 2.2 many methods that previously returned <code>void</code> now return the method's instance, to promote method chaining.
  GoJS 2.2 also introduces several new methods or arguments to allow type-checking of settings by compilers and in text editors.
</p>
  Several existing methods now return their instance:
  <ul>
    <li><a>GraphObject.setProperties</a> and <a>Diagram.setProperties</a> - and their new synonyms <a>GraphObject.attach</a> and <a>Diagram.attach</a> </li>
    <li><a>Panel.add</a></li>
    <li><a>GraphObject.bind</a>, which also has new functionality via method overloads.</li>
    <li><a>GraphObject.trigger</a> - to add <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s to a GraphObject</li>
    <li><a>Diagram.addEventListener</a>, <a>Diagram.addChangedListener</a>, <a>Diagram.addModelChangedListener</a>, <a>Model.addChangedListener</a></li>
    <li><a>Diagram.addLayer</a>, <a>Diagram.addLayerBefore</a>, <a>Diagram.addLayerAfter</a></li>
    <li><a>Animation.add</a>, and <a>Animation.addTemporaryPart</a></li>
  </ul>

  GraphObject constructors now accept one or two optional arguments. The first is the value for a common property,
  and the second is a JavaScript Object detailing properties to initialize. For example, one can now write:
  <ul>
    <li><code>new go.TextBlock("Some Text", { margin: 5 })</code></li>
    <li><code>new go.Picture("sourceURI.png", { width: 30, height: 30 })</code></li>
    <li><code>new go.Shape("RoundedRectangle", { fill: "blue", stroke: "yellow" })</code></li>
    <li><code>new go.Panel("Auto", { padding: 10, background: "green" })</code></li>
  </ul>

<p>This means that one can now write code like:</p>
<pre class="lang-js"><code>// Create a Node and add a Shape and a TextBlock to it:
myDiagram.nodeTemplate =
  new go.Node("Vertical")
    .add(new go.Shape({ width: 40, height: 40, fill: "white" })  // default width & height & fill
          .bind("width") // binds data.width to Shape.width
          .bind("height")
          .bind("fill", "color") // binds data.color to Shape.fill
          .bind("figure", "fig")) // data.fig should be the registered name of a geometry figure generator
    .add(new go.TextBlock("(no name)",  // default string to display
                          { isMultiline: false, editable: true })
          .bind("text", "name", null, null));  // TwoWay Binding of TextBlock.text with data.name without converters
</code></pre>

<p>
  New methods <a>GraphObject.set</a> and <a>Diagram.set</a> return their instance.
  When using TypeScript definitions, the compiler checks these calls for GraphObject and Diagram property existence and value types.
</p>

<p>
  New method <a>GraphObject.apply</a> can be used to define common functions that provide settings and bindings.
  Such customizations can then be applied to a GraphObject that you are initializing by calling <a>GraphObject.apply</a> with that function.
</p>

<p>
  Together, these changes remove the need to use <a>GraphObject,make</a> when concisely defining Diagrams and templates.
  For a complete example, this code:
</p>

<pre class="lang-js"><code>const $ = go.GraphObject.make;

const myDiagram = $(go.Diagram, "myDiagramDiv",
  {
    "undoManager.isEnabled": true
  });

myDiagram.nodeTemplate =
  $(go.Node, "Auto",
    $(go.Shape, "RoundedRectangle",
      { strokeWidth: 0, fill: "white" },
      new go.Binding("fill", "color")),
    $(go.TextBlock,
      { margin: 8, font: "bold 14px sans-serif", stroke: '#333' },
      new go.Binding("text", "key"))
  );
</code></pre>

<p>Can now be written as:</p>

<pre class="lang-js"><code>const myDiagram = new go.Diagram("myDiagramDiv",
  {
    "undoManager.isEnabled": true
  });

myDiagram.nodeTemplate =
  new go.Node("Auto")
    .add(new go.Shape("RoundedRectangle", { strokeWidth: 0, fill: "white" })
          .bind("fill", "color"))
    .add(new go.TextBlock({ margin: 8, font: "bold 14px sans-serif", stroke: '#333' })
          .bind("text", "key"));
</code></pre>

<p>

</p>

<h3>General New Features in GoJS 2.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Spot Panels now support <a>Panel.alignmentFocusName</a> on the main element.
    This can be useful for creating Spot panels with multiple item arrays that align to the same main element.
    There is an example of this property in the
    <a href="intro/panels.html#AligningSubElementsSpotPanels">Spot Panel section of the Panel intro page</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Diagram.autoScrollInterval</a> property controls the milliseconds between autoscroll events.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Diagram.delayInitialization</a>'s argument function is now a passed a reference to the Diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Overview.drawsGrid</a> and <a>Overview.updateDelay</a> properties control drawing by an Overview.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>CommandHandler.isZoomToFitRestoreEnabled</a> property controls whether the <a>CommandHandler.zoomToFit</a>
    command ever restores the previous Diagram scale and position.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>DraggingTool.copyCursor</a>, <a>DraggingTool.moveCursor</a>, and <a>DraggingTool.nodropCursor</a> properties modify the cursors during a drag.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>LinkingBaseTool.linkingCursor</a> property modifies the cursor during linking.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>GraphObject.findBindingPanel</a> method walks up the visual tree to return the first Panel whose <a>Panel.data</a> is bound to data.
    Used  in the <a href="extensions/Hyperlink.html" target="_blank">Hyperlink</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Panel.copyTemplate</a> method makes a deep copy of a Panel, including its Bindings, to allow use of the result in templates.
    This is used in <a href="/extras/linkLabelsInFront.html" target="_blank">LinkLabels In Front</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>TextBlock.formatting</a> property controls the policy of trimming whitespace on TextBlock text.
    This can be useful when text strings are preformatted.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>TextBlock.lineHeight</a> read-only property provides better information about how the text is being measured and rendered.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>TextBlock.spacingAbove</a> and <a>TextBlock.spacingBelow</a> properties
    better control the measuring and rendering in addition to the <a>TextBlock.lineHeight</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Node.findExternalTreeLinksConnected</a> method returns a collection of Links that connect with this Node
    or any in its subtree, excluding any isTreeLink Links.
    This is the tree-equivalent of <a>Group.findExternalLinksConnected</a> for Groups/subgraphs.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Node.findVisibleNode</a> method walks up the chain of <a>Node.containingGroup</a>s to find the first node that is visible.
    This can be overridden to change behavior, as it is in <a href="samples/treeMapper.html" target="_blank">Tree Mapper</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>PanelLayout.remeasureObject</a> method forces a specific GraphObject (but none of its containing panels) to remeasure.
    This can be useful implementing custom layouts.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>DraggingTool</a> now optimizes transactions to reduce memory usage by only saving the first and last drag changes.
    This can be changed by overriding <a>DraggingTool.stopTransaction</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Binding</a> constructor now accepts a back-converter as an argument.
    A null or function argument value as the fourth argument will automatically call <a>Binding.makeTwoWay</a>> for you.
    Not supplying the fourth argument or passing it undefined will leave the Binding OneWay, as it has in the past.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>RadialLayout</a> extension by default spreads the children better.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>TextEditingTool</a> now stops any default animation when the tool is activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>TextEditingTool</a> now respects the vertical alignment when a TextBlock is taller than its text.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>InputEvent.bubbles</a> allows events to bubble beyond the Diagram div.
    This can be useful in <a>CommandHandler</a> and <a>Tool</a> method overrides.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>For some testing environments:</em> <a>Diagram,isUsingDOM</a> and <a>Diagram,useDOM</a>
    can query and control the GoJS library's expectation of a DOM existing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression from 2.1.29 where some links may update their geometries outside of a transaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Potentially incompatible:</em> Touch and Mouse events have been replaced internally with Pointer events.
    The GoJS API has not changed, nor has its behavior, as long as the browser is not so old that it does not implement pointer events.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Easier Manipulation and Customization of Geometries</h3>

<p>
  GoJS 2.2 contains new methods to simplify geometric calculations and more easily customize geometries.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a>Point,intersectingLineSegments</a> is a static function that returns true if two finite straight line segments intersect each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Rect,intersectsLineSegment</a> is a static function that returns true if a rectangular area is intersected by a finite straight line segment.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Point,compareWithLineSegment</a> is a static function that compares a point with a finite straight line segment, given x,y numbers.
    <a>Point.compareWithLineSegmentPoint</a> is a method that performs the same comparison, but on Points.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Geometry.containsPoint</a> is a method that returns true if the Geometry contains a given point.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Link.routeBounds</a> read-only property returns the bounds of the Link geometry in document coordinates.
    Used in the <a href="extensions/BalloonLink.html" target="_blank">BalloonLink</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Node.getAvoidableRect</a> method returns the area to be avoided for this node,
    by default equal to the node's <a>GraphObject.actualBounds</a> plus the <a>Node.avoidableMargin</a>.
    This method can be overridden to customize AvoidsNodes routing behavior near a node to account for the visual area occupied by the node
    being smaller than the full rectangular bounds of the node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Groups now implement <a>Panel.isClipping</a>.
    If set to true on a Group and if the group has a <a>Group.placeholder</a>,
    the group will visually clip its member nodes and links.
    This does not change how those parts are measured, nor does it affect how those parts may be positioned.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Layer.isInDocumentBounds</a> property allows finer control of which layers are part of the <a>Diagram.documentBounds</a>.
    Before 2.2, only layers with <a>Layer.isTemporary</a> set to true were excluded from the document bounds (and could not be explicitly included).
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>ResizingTool.oppositePoint</a> property returns the Point opposite to the chosen, dragged handle of the "Resizing" Adornment.
    This allows customizations like the
    <a href="/extras/groupResizingLimited.html" target="_blank">LimitedGroupResizingTool</a> sample,
    which demonstrates a custom tool to allow resizing groups while disallowing the group to resize smaller than its members,
    and also disallowing the group to expand to cover any non-member nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>RoundedRectangles</code> extension code now includes definitions for the "RoundedLeftRectangle" and "RoundedRightRectangle" figures.
    The definitions for all four "Rounded...Rectangle" figures has been modified slightly to better match the curves of a full "RoundedRectangle".
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="2.2.14">Changes for 2.2.14</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Diagram Layouts with <a>Layout.isRealtime</a> set to <code>true</code> will no longer attempt real-time layouts during the <a>DraggingTool</a> operation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graduated Panels now deal with highly precise floating point numbers more accurately.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4 id="2.2.13">Changes for 2.2.13</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed asynchronous model loading which might intermittently fail to perform AvoidsNodes routing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhanced the <a>ArrangingLayout</a> extension to support placing the side nodes about the middle of the side,
    by supporting values such as <code>go.Spot.Bottom</code> for the <a>ArrangingLayout.side</a> property.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the "HyperlinkText" builder extension so that it works by default in <a>Adornment</a>s and
    other Parts that are in temporary layers, by setting <a>GraphObject.isActionable</a> to true.
  </li>
  <li>
    Table panel separator strokes no longer draw if a row or column is empty of visual elements,
    and will not draw a separator above the first-rendered row/col.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.12">Changes for 2.2.12</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have been optimizing the space used by GraphObjects.
    The heap used by typical large diagrams now occupies about 10% less space.
    Creating copies of a lot of nodes and links may be a bit faster now too.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the new <a>PanelLayoutFlow</a> extension so that multiple "Flow" panels can coexist in the same panel</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved GenogramLayout in the <a href="samples/genogram.html" target="_blank">Genogram</a> sample
    to support a horizontal direction as well as the standard vertical direction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the <a href="samples/selectableFields.html" target="_blank">Selectable Fields</a>
    and <a href="samples/selectablePorts.html" target="_blank">Selectable Ports</a>
    samples so that clicking on fields or ports within a node respects the Control and Shift modifiers
    to toggle or add to the collection of selected fields or ports.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed object picking (<a>Diagram.findObject</a>, <a>GraphObject.containsPoint</a>, etc) for Shapes with a <a>GraphObject.background</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>Group.layout</a> property setter now checks to make sure that the new layout is not also the value of <a>Diagram.layout</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.11">Changes for 2.2.11</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Like the <a>DraggingTool</a> in v2.2.0, <a>LinkReshapingTool</a>, <a>ResizingTool</a>, and <a>RotatingTool</a> now optimize transactions
    to reduce memory usage by only saving the first and last changes for each property of each object in the transaction.
    This can be changed by overriding <b>stopTransaction</b> on the respective tool.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Shape.graduatedSkip</a>, <a>TextBlock.graduatedSkip</a>, and <a>TextBlock.graduatedFunction</a>
    now take a second argument, the Shape or TextBlock that the function is being called for.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graduated Panels now correctly draw ticks/labels at very large <a>Panel.graduatedMax</a> values.
  </li>
  <li>
    The AMD <code>define</code> statement has been removed from the module version of the library
    (<code>go-module.js</code>, <code>go.mjs</code>, <code>go-debug-module.js</code>)
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>DraggingTool</a>, when dragging a Link (<a>DraggingTool.draggedLink</a>), now passes that link as the <a>RelinkingTool.originalLink</a>
    so that link validation predicates are passed that link.
  </li>
  <li>
    Disconnected links now support setting <a>Part.locationSpot</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.10">Changes for 2.2.10</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Graduated panels now draw all tick marks specifying a <a>Shape.graduatedSkip</a>/<a>TextBlock.graduatedSkip</a> function,
    even when they could be very close together.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed drawing on very zoomed-out graphs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Multiple orthogonal links between identical nodes side-by-side are now drawn without crossings. This fixes a regression from 2.1.51.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.9">Changes for 2.2.9</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression from 2.2.8 with Table Panel when tables are empty (including tables in Node templates).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.8">Changes for 2.2.8</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved Table Panel measuring when using TableRows and TableColumns in sparsely populated tables.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved Table Panel arranging of items that span several rows or columns, when those rows or columns do not all exist.
  </li>
  <li>
    Animation fixes when <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s execute during a drag.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved accuracy of tick angles along curves in Graduated panels.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for two-way bindings on <a>Part.location</a> when undoing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calls to <a>Diagram.makeImage</a> and <a>Diagram.makeImageData</a> no longer throw exceptions when attempting to render "broken" images.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.7">Changes for 2.2.7</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Nested or space-constrained Table Panels apportion space more correctly when some Table elements are stretched
    and other rows/columns have their width or height set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the ScrollingTable extension to include a scrollbar "thumb".
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.6">Changes for 2.2.6</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Made improvements in gesture handling for iPad + keyboard combinations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Made improvements and added features to the <a href="samples/gantt.html" target="_blank">Gantt</a>
    and <a href="samples/donutCharts.html" target="_blank">Donut Charts</a> samples.
  </li>
  <li>
    Drag and drop from a Diagram into empty page space no longer throws an error (regression in 2.2.4).
  </li>
  <li>
    Data <a>Inspector</a>, when <code>multipleSelection</code> option is true,
    now clears the properties fields when the <a>Diagram.selection</a> is empty.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.5">Changes for 2.2.5</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Drag and drop across Diagrams fixed on touch devices (regression in 2.2.4 for non Shadow DOM environments).
  </li>
  <li>
    Module versions of the library <code>release/go.mjs</code> and <code>release/go-module.js</code> now export <code>go</code> as the default export.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.4">Changes for 2.2.4</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Allow <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s to run during Tool operation.
    Previously, Animation Triggers would not run if a Tool was active,
    which prevented some tools such as <a>LinkingTool</a> from starting animations during their events.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression since 2.2.0: Drag and drop in Shadow DOM environments such as Angular
    now correctly identify the target Diagram (for dropping from Palettes, for instance).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Diagram,useDOM</a> and <a>Diagram,isUsingDOM</a> were incorrectly minified, and now have their names properly exposed.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.3">Changes for 2.2.3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed Spot Panels erroneously giving incorrect sizing information to its elements if a previous element had a stretch.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved <a>LayeredDigraphLayout</a> routing of Bezier curve links to reduce crossing over nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed optimization (in 2.0.0) of <a>Panel.rebuildItemElements</a> when item template(s) may have changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <code>package.json</code> now specifies <code>"module": "release/go-module.js"</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.2">Changes for 2.2.2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <code>init</code> optional argument to <a>Brush</a> constructor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stopped tap-hold on some versions of iOS Safari from selecting text.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improvements for licensing Electron apps.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.2.1">Changes for 2.2.1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added rounded corners to the <a>BalloonLink</a> extension, controlled by the new property <a>BalloonLink.corner</a>.
    Improved <a>BalloonLink</a>'s implementation of <a>BalloonLink.base</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed licensing issues when using Windows high contrast mode, due to changes in Chrome and Edge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>init</code> optional argument to <a>Layer</a> and <a>Animation</a> constructors. <a>Animation.start</a> and <a>Animation.stop</a> now return <code>this</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="2.1">GoJS 2.1</h2>

<h3>New Animation Capabilities</h3>

<p>GoJS 2.1 contains a number of new features to animate different components of your Diagram.</p>

<p>
  See the <a href="intro/animation.html" target="_blank">Intro page on Animation</a>
  and the <a href="samples/customAnimations.html" target="_blank">Custom Animation sample</a> for more details and examples.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    New default GoJS animation "fades up", instead of animating Node locations. Added <a>AnimationManager.initialAnimationStyle</a>
    to control this behavior.
    Here is an example of:
    <ul>
      <li>
        (top) The new initial animation, the Diagram position animating upwards and Diagram opacity animating
        from 0 to 1.
      <li>
        (middle) A custom "zoom in" animation, animating Diagram scale, which is demonstrated in
        the new <a href="samples/stateChart.html" target="_blank">State Chart</a> sample,
      <li>
        (bottom) <a>AnimationManager.initialAnimationStyle</a> set to <a>AnimationManager.AnimateLocations</a> to
        perform the GoJS 2.0 and previous style of animation.
        The <a href="samples/dataVisualization.html" target="_blank">Data Visualization</a> sample uses this
        option.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <code>"InitialAnimationStarting"</code> <a>DiagramEvent</a> to more easily customize initial animations.
    See <a>AnimationManager.initialAnimationStyle</a> for details.
  </li>
  <li>
    New class: <a>AnimationTrigger</a>. These describe how to automatically animate a property on a GraphObject
    when it changes value.
  </li>
  <li>
    New class: <a>Animation</a>. This class lets you declaratively setup custom animations, with options for
    indefinite animations.
  </li>
  <li>
    New <a>AnimationManager</a> options, including the ability to define custom animation effects to animate with
    <a>AnimationManager,defineAnimationEffect</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    New Animation samples and samples modified to use new Animation features:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/customAnimations.html" target="_blank">Custom Animation</a> - <strong>New Sample:</strong>
        Demonstrating a number of Node creation/deletion animations, linking animations, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/treeLoadAnimation.html" target="_blank">Tree Load Animation</a> - <strong>New Sample:</strong>
        recursive animation upon model load.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/flowchart.html" target="_blank">Flowchart</a> - In the Palette only, initial animation
        is disabled in favor of a custom fade-in animation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/stateChart.html" target="_blank">State Chart</a> - Initial animation is disabled in
        favor of a custom zoom fade-in animation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/dataVisualization.html" target="_blank">Data Visualization</a> - Nodes now move using an
        <a>AnimationTrigger</a>.
      </li>
      <li><a href="samples/kittenMonitor.html" target="_blank">Kitten Monitor</a> - Kittens now move using an <a>AnimationTrigger</a>.</li>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/processFlow.html" target="_blank">Process Flow</a> - An indefinite Animation of the
        Links' strokeDashArray.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="samples/shopFloorMonitor.html" target="_blank">Shop Floor Monitor</a> - Link color changes now
        use an <a>AnimationTrigger</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Improved Support For Data Synchronization</h3>

<p>
  GoJS 2.1 contains some new methods to ease integration of GoJS diagrams in applications that maintain their own
  data, particularly React apps.
</p>

<p>
  See the <a href="intro/react.html" target="_blank">Intro page on using GoJS with React</a> and
  the <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-react-basic" target="_blank">gojs-react example project</a> for details and examples.
  Also see <a href="https://github.com/NorthwoodsSoftware/gojs-react" target="_blank">gojs-react</a>, a package
  containing React Components for GoJS Diagrams, Palettes, and Overviews.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    New method: <a>Model.toIncrementalData</a>. This method outputs an <a>IncrementalData</a> object containing
    changes that occurred within a <a>Transaction</a>,
    similar to the existing method, <a>Model.toIncrementalJson</a>. It can be used to keep outside data
    synchronized with the GoJS model.
  </li>
  <li>
    New methods: <a>Model.mergeNodeDataArray</a> and <a>GraphLinksModel.mergeLinkDataArray</a>. These methods are
    used to merge outside data changes into the GoJS model.
  </li>
  <li>
    New method: <a>Model.cloneDeep</a>. This method can be used to make a deep copy of an object, which may be
    useful to ensure GoJS doesn't share references with outside state.
    It is also used within <a>Model.toIncrementalData</a> to ensure <a>IncrementalData</a>'s list of modified
    objects won't contain references to the model's data objects, if the external data is required to be immutable.
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4 id="2.1.56">Changes for 2.1.56</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Updated the root object for systems that define <code>window</code> but do not attach all global variables to it.
    GoJS now prefers <code>globalThis</code> if it exists, then <code>global</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.55">Changes for 2.1.55</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed some improper shadows in the SVG output of <a>Diagram.makeSVG</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.54">Changes for 2.1.54</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.viewSize</a> when setting it to a real value and then later setting it back to a NaN value.
  </li>
  <li>
    As with 2.1.52, fixed more scenarios with custom animations improperly adding state to the <a>AnimationManager.defaultAnimation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed rare cases of <a>LayeredDigraphLayout</a> trying to get the "centerX" property of a null vertex.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the <a>RelinkingTool</a> not to automatically select the link that was reconnected.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.53">Changes for 2.1.53</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Binding.ofModel</a> binding when there is no <a>Diagram</a> and thus no <a>Model</a> to just ignore the binding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression in <a>Diagram.makeSVG</a> from 2.1.49 when using a <a>Panel,Spot</a> with <a>Panel.isClipping</a> set to <code>true</code>,
    where some elements would get grouped and positioned incorrectly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Model.toJson</a> output when object keys contained unescaped double-quote characters.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some Shape Geometry intersections (such as with Link connections) when the Shape's Geometry contained small and flat beziers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed collapsed Parts incorrectly causing their Groups to remeasure, which may have caused Group's connected Links to re-route.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.52">Changes for 2.1.52</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed animations incorrectly resetting some link routes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed custom animations improperly adding state to the <a>AnimationManager.defaultAnimation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression in 2.1.51 where un-modeled parts containing Images, that are added before a model is set, may fail to load.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression from 2.1.50 when <a>Picture.errorFunction</a> was used to modify the <a>Picture.source</a> or <a>Picture.element</a>, which would cause a "Collection was modified during iteration" error.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.51">Changes for 2.1.51</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <a>TextEditingTool</a>, when the user has entered an invalid text string, has always called any
    <a>TextBlock.errorFunction</a> and then continued showing the text editor so that the user could fix their text entry.
    The <a>TextEditingTool.doError</a> method now calls any <a>TextBlock.errorFunction</a> and
    also calls <a>HTMLInfo.show</a> on the <a>TextEditingTool.currentTextEditor</a>.
    This will allow an override of <a>TextEditingTool.doError</a> not to continue showing the editor.
    If you have not overridden that method, which was new in 2.1, this change will not affect you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Model,fromJson</a> not to substitute instances of classes such as <a>Point</a> and <a>Size</a> when the Object's
    "class" property had a value that is "Point" or "Size".
    The property value must be what is produced by <a>Model.toJson</a>, which uses values such as "go.Point" or "go.Size".
    The documentation lists all of the substitution cases that <a>Model,fromJson</a> handles.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression from 2.1.43 which caused some links to animate routes incorrectly upon dragging.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed loading Images used as a <a>Picture.element</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved some AvoidsNodes routing of Links when connecting Nodes in different Groups and the Groups are not <a>Group.avoidable</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed using multiple license keys.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.50">Changes for 2.1.50</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Enhanced the <a>LinkShiftingTool</a> extension to support links that are only connected at one end.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>CommandHandler.doKeyDown</a> to support <a>Robot.keyDown</a> use of "F2" and "ContextMenu" keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved routing of AvoidsNodes links that have a "to" end segment with a direction that is a multiple of 45 (but not 90) degrees.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed diagram not redrawing after images load in frameworks that use a shadow DOM, such as Angular.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you call <a>TextBlock,setBaseline</a> or <a>TextBlock,setUnderline</a> outside of your diagram initialization,
    you should also call <a>Diagram.redraw</a> on all Diagrams.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.49">Changes for 2.1.49</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="extensions/PanelLayoutFlow.js" target="_blank">Flow PanelLayout</a> extension,
    demonstrated in the <a href="extensions/PanelLayoutFlow.html" target="_blank">Flow PanelLayout</a> sample.
    This panel layout (not a diagram layout!) arranges panel elements into rows or columns.
    As time goes by we may add more properties to control the behavior of this custom panel layout.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed undo/redo bug involving setting <a>RowColumnDefinition</a> properties and calls to <a>Panel.removeColumnDefinition</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Picture.successFunction</a> erroneously being called twice in some situations, such as when a node was copy-pasted.
  </li>
  <li>Fixed <a>Diagram.makeSVG</a> not rendering shadows on some GraphObjects.</li>
  <li>Fixed <a>Diagram.makeSVG</a> not clipping when using a <a>Panel,Spot</a> with <a>Panel.isClipping</a> set to <code>true</code>.</li>
  <li>Improved visual consistency of shadows in SVG output from <a>Diagram.makeSVG</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.48">Changes for 2.1.48</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Panel.removeRowDefinition</a> and <a>Panel.removeColumnDefinition</a>
    to decrease the <a>Panel.rowCount</a> and <a>Panel.columnCount</a>
    when the highest index <a>RowColumnDefinition</a> is removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Picture.successFunction</a>, which was called for only the first Picture with a given unique <a>Picture.source</a>.
    It is now called for every Picture that has a <code>successFunction</code> defined with the same (successfully loaded) source.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.47">Changes for 2.1.47</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.layoutDiagram</a> not performing a layout immediately if called within an ongoing Diagram update
    (such as during a <a>DiagramEvent</a> like <code>"InitialLayoutCompleted"</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Panel.itemTemplate</a> so that it is used, not the default item template, when the panel cannot find any
    template with the given category name in the item data.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Diagram.viewSize</a>, if set, now takes precedence over the size of the <a>Diagram.div</a>.
    It is not typical to set both a DIV and the <code>viewSize</code>, but in environments where a DIV is set automatically
    it may be useful for testing purposes to set an explicit <code>viewSize</code> as well.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.46">Changes for 2.1.46</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed indefinite animations causing some transactions to skip the <a>UndoManager</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.makeImageData</a> to draw any other Parts in the "Grid" Layer besides the Part holding the <a>Diagram.grid</a>
    when the <code>showGrid</code> option is true but the <code>showTemporary</code> option is false.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.45">Changes for 2.1.45</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a bounds calculation bug with <a>PathSegment,SvgArc</a>s, when the arc has a zero X or Y radius value.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link route calculations now avoid an effectively infinite loop due to floating point errors when the two ports almost exactly overlap each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an occasional exception when dragging a disconnected link when the link had no points in its route.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>GraphObject.naturalBounds</a> of a <a>Shape</a> now always prefers <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> if it exists, over the Shape's <a>Geometry.bounds</a>.
    These are usually the same, but a Geometry with beziers can be slightly off from the desiredSize used to create it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.44">Changes for 2.1.44</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression from 2.1.28 with some <a>Shape.geometryString</a> paths.
    If a path contained an arc command that was closed, a relative move command afterwards would be at
    the wrong coordinates.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.43">Changes for 2.1.43</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved performance of <a>LayeredDigraphLayout</a> for large graphs when <a>LayeredDigraphLayout.packOption</a>
    is set to <a>LayeredDigraphLayout,PackAll</a>.
    Setting <a>LayeredDigraphLayout.packOption</a> to a subset of the possible flags has always helped performance at the expense of improved layout.
    Also, it has always helped to set <a>LayeredDigraphLayout.aggressiveOption</a> to <a>LayeredDigraphLayout,AggressiveNone</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed non-default indefinite animations preventing the default animation from starting. Fixed some other non-default animation bugs, such as indefinite animations preventing Overviews from updating.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enhanced <a>LinkingTool.findLinkablePort</a>, when <a>LinkingTool.startObject</a> is a Node and the whole node is not a port,
    to return the node's default port <a>Node.port</a> instead of null, if the port is a valid port for linking from or to.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.42">Changes for 2.1.42</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed an animation bug with <a>ResizingTool</a> where it would disable all animations on resizing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Setting <a>AnimationManager.isEnabled</a> to false and then true again will resume any indefinite animations (animations with <a>Animation.runCount</a> set to <code>Infinity</code>).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed RadialLayout not properly resetting its network. This was most often seen when using with
    <a>Diagram.delayInitialization</a> (including gojs-react and gojs-angular).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.41">Changes for 2.1.41</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved the animation of colors in <a>Animation</a>s.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="extensions/SpotRotatingTool.js" target="_blank">Spot Rotating Tool</a> extension,
    demonstrated in the <a href="extensions/SpotRotating.html" target="_blank">Spot Rotating</a> sample.
    This is basically the <a>RotatingTool</a> extended to support an additional Adornment and handle for
    letting the user interactively move the <a>RotatingTool.rotationPoint</a> by setting
    <a>Part.rotationSpot</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Added an Introduction page about <a href="intro/platforms.html">Using GoJS on Different Platforms</a>, summarizing existing resources for them.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.40">Changes for 2.1.40</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed some styling and missing files in the web site as a result of the reorganization in 2.1.39.
  </li>
  <li>
    Simplified the Storage and FloorplannerTS projects.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.39">Changes for 2.1.39</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Reorganized GoJS kit and site. <code>gojs</code> package no longer contains jQuery, and samples that reference jQuery use a CDN.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed animating the position of GraphObjects inside a Position Panel.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.38">Changes for 2.1.38</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Table panel fixes with stretch elements, this includes a regression fix from 2.1.35.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression (for IE11 only) from 2.1.37, which broke mouse events.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.37">Changes for 2.1.37</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added an Introduction page about <a href="intro/testing.html">Testing</a> with Jest and with Cypress.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some scenarios with Table Panels not apportioning space correctly when elements stretched
    and rows/columns had minimums or maximums set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed touch-dragging between Diagrams in frameworks that use a shadow DOM (like Angular).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed routing invalidation of links to nodes in collapsed groups that have "...Sides" Spots.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed shadows on unfilled <a>PathFigures</a> when a <a>GraphObject.fill</a> was set. This mostly presented itself when shadowing bezier or orthogonal Link paths.
    This fix may cause Links with a Link Label to draw a shadow on the Link path where none was previously. If you do not want the Link path shaded, you must set
    <a>GraphObject.shadowVisible</a> to <code>false</code> on the Link path Shape.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.36">Changes for 2.1.36</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed "Graduated" Panels rendering of final tick mark in some cases where due to floating point errors
    the tick mark was not drawn.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Link.getLinkPointFromPoint</a> for some cases where the start point was inside the target port shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    One can now avoid invalidating the routes of other links that connect the same pair of ports
    when links between them are added or removed, by setting <a>Link.curviness</a> to a number such as zero.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.35">Changes for 2.1.35</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed jitter that occurred when dragging between diagrams with a modifier key held down.
  </li>
  <li>
    When dragging between diagrams, fixed the loss of routing of partly or fully disconnected reshaped links
    that have TwoWay Bindings on "points", and fixed the positioning of multiple fully disconnected links.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a shadow-drawing bug that could occur when <a>Part.isShadowed</a> is false but <a>GraphObject.shadowVisible</a> is true.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.34">Changes for 2.1.34</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved performance for off-screen Adornments and Parts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed exception regarding Workers when running in a web Worker.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.33">Changes for 2.1.33</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Improved AvoidsNodes routing performance for many common cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved <a>ContextMenuTool.canStart</a> to return false for double or triple context clicks.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.32">Changes for 2.1.32</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed auto-scrolling not to do so in the directions in which <a>Diagram.allowHorizontalScroll</a> and
    <a>Diagram.allowVerticalScroll</a> disallow it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the positioning of nodes and links when an animation is stopped during a drag that operates on the same Parts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.makeSvg</a> where the SVG would not include <a>Picture.source</a> in headless browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed Diagram initialization when no Diagram DIV is specified, but setting some properties expected one (such as <a>Diagram.scrollMargin</a>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.31">Changes for 2.1.31</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression since 2.1.30 where the library might not load in React or Angular environments, and a TypeError would be thrown.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed dragging of links connected with snapped nodes when the grid cell size was not an integer,
    causing the links to slowly shift over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed rendering of background in images drawn by <a>Diagram.makeImageData</a> when the whole page has been scaled to be less than 100%.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.delayInitialization</a> when calling code that prompts the Diagram to update immediately afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed premature routing of links in Groups that start off collapsed (with <a>Group.isSubGraphExpanded</a> set or bound to false).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed animation that might revert some routes when the initial animation was turned off.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Link.computeAdjusting</a> now only returns <a>Link,End</a> during animation only when routing is AvoidsNodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression since 2.1.29 where an <a>Overview</a> would not update with a newly set <a>Overview.observed</a> Diagram
    and a newly displayed HTMLDivElement until some activity happened on that observed Diagram.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.30">Changes for 2.1.30</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Changed the behavior of <a>GraphLinksModel</a> so that the use of a key of a non-existent node
    can be resolved by adding a node with that key in a later transaction, not just in the same transaction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed routing of duplicate orthogonal links between ports with "...Side" Spots to avoid producing little loops
    when the ports are close to each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>ContextMenuTool</a> to automatically stop running if the newly shown context menu is
    a not-<a>GraphObject.visible</a> <a>Adornment</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed exception on expanding a <a>Group</a> whose member nodes had partly disconnected links.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.29">Changes for 2.1.29</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Overviews now wait for the Diagram to draw first before attempting to draw.
    This solves timing issues with <a>Diagram.delayInitialization</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed delays in updating the <a>Link.geometry</a> after changing properties such as <a>Link.corner</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed setting <a>Diagram.scrollMargin</a> during Diagram initialization, which would interrupt the initial transaction.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.28">Changes for 2.1.28</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a>Diagram.ensureBounds</a> method.
    Like <a>Part.ensureBounds</a>, this is useful when you need the document bounds computed immediately.
    It is rare that you will need to call either method, because the normal updating process will
    perform the computations for you as part of a transaction, asynchronously.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some parsing issues when using <a>Geometry.parse</a> or <a>Shape.geometryString</a> with SVG arcs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the <a>Picture.source</a> setter from failing in non-DOM environments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for DOM-less environments that do not have <code>setImmediate</code> defined.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fix for Link routing when connecting to the edge of an arc segment.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.27">Changes for 2.1.27</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed the routing of links connected with nodes that are members of expanded groups inside collapsed groups.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some Shapes in Link Selection Adornments inheriting their <code>strokeWidth</code> from the Link.
    Only the main path Shapes of Link "Selection" Adornments with a <code>strokeWidth</code> of 0 will inherit
    the <code>strokeWidth</code> from the adorned <a>Link.path</a> Shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed changing <a>Picture.source</a> back to an empty string not to throw an unnecessary error.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.26">Changes for 2.1.26</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added a <code>ResizeObserver</code> to automatically detect changes in the size of the
    HTMLDivElement (the <a>Diagram.div</a>) in recent browsers.
    You will still need to call <a>Diagram.requestUpdate</a> when running in older browsers or in Internet Explorer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <a>ResizingTool.dragsMembers</a> property, for controlling whether resizing a
    <a>Group</a> may move its <a>Group.memberParts</a> if it has no <a>Placeholder</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed regression since 2.1.24 causing some diagrams not to be drawn even after calling <a>Diagram.requestUpdate</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some cases of finding the nearest intersection point of Bezier curves with a straight finite line.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.25">Changes for 2.1.25</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/connectionBoxNode.html">Connection Box Node</a> sample,
    showing nodes that allow links between ports within a node.
  </li>
  <li>
    In order to avoid possible errors caused by loading the GoJS library more than once,
    an Error is thrown when a second load is detected, even if the version number is the same.
    This helps avoid problems where there are multiple definitions for each of the classes, causing errors such as:
    <code>Error: Unknown type of binding target: Node#241</code>, where the object is a GoJS <a>Node</a>,
    but not the same GoJS Node class as the code expects.
    It also helps avoid situations when both the release library and the debug library are loaded.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed raising an extraneous <a>Diagram.mouseOver</a> event during initialization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression since 2.1.0 that would prevent a Diagram or Overview from re-scaling or aligning when its DIV changed size.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed invalidating routes of external links when nested groups change their visibility in ways
    other than expanding trees or subgraphs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Model.mergeNodeDataArray</a>, <a>GraphLinksModel.mergeLinkDataArray</a>, and <a>Model.applyIncrementalJson</a>
    to set known properties, eg. <a>GraphLinksModel.nodeGroupKeyProperty</a>, even when the property is not present on the new data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.24">Changes for 2.1.24</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/multiColorLinks.html">Multi-color Links</a> sample,
    showing links whose paths can be stroked with multiple colors specified in an Array
    as the value of the link's <code>data.colors</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Associating a <a>Diagram</a> instance with an HTMLDivElement now causes that Div element to get two new properties:
    "goDiagram" to refer to that Diagram instance, and "go" to refer to the "go" namespace if it exists.
    This makes it easier to examine or set Diagram properties or to call Diagram methods or methods on GraphObjects
    in existing apps without access to the app's source code.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed using subclasses of <a>GraphLinksModel</a> or <a>TreeModel</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s incorrectly starting when <a>AnimationManager.isEnabled</a> is set to <code>false</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed extraneous Transaction <a>ChangedEvent</a>s when modifying a group invalidated a layout.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.23">Changes for 2.1.23</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="extensions/ArrangingLayout.js" target="_blank">Arranging Layout</a> extension,
    demonstrated in the <a href="extensions/Arranging.html" target="_blank">Arranging</a> sample.
    This layout is basically a layout of layouts, so that you can have a <a>CircularLayout</a> of <a>CircularLayout</a>s,
    as shown in the sample, or a <a>PackedLayout</a> of <a>TableLayout</a>s, or whatever.
    The <a>ArrangingLayout</a> also has a third layout that is used to position nodes not arranged by the main layout.
    This is normally a <a>GridLayout</a> that only positions singleton (disconnected) nodes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the <a>ParallelLayout</a> extension and rewrote the
    <a href="samples/flowgrammer.html" target="_blank">Flowgrammer</a> sample to use that <b>ParallelLayout</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>UndoManager</a> sometimes adding a duplicate "Layout" transaction to the <a>UndoManager.history</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.22">Changes for 2.1.22</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="extensions/RescalingTool.js" target="_blank">Rescaling Tool</a> extension,
    demonstrated in the <a href="extensions/Rescaling.html" target="_blank">Rescaling</a> sample.
    This tool modifies the <a>GraphObject.scale</a> property,
    unlike the <a>ResizingTool</a> which modifies the <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> property.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved performance of <a>Model.mergeNodeDataArray</a>, <a>GraphLinksModel.mergeLinkDataArray</a>, and <a>Model.toIncrementalData</a>.
    The merge methods require that references are not shared between the the GoJS model and the external data provided and will now make deep copies
    of any new data objects before adding them to the model. This means <a>Model.cloneDeep</a> doesn't need to be called on the arrays passed in,
    as the merge methods will make the necessary calls.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed `go-module.js` to work when treated as an ES6 module in Node.js.
    At the same time we have added `go.mjs` and `go-debug.mjs` as copies of `go-module.js` and `go-debug-module.js`.
    For compatibility the kit will contain both sets of files.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed automatically performing layouts of outer groups after inner nested groups changed size.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.21">Changes for 2.1.21</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="extensions/SwimLaneLayout.js" target="_blank">Swim Lane Layout</a> extension,
    demonstrated in the <a href="extensions/SwimLaneLayout.html" target="_blank">Swim Lane Layout</a> sample.
    This layout is a version of <a>LayeredDigraphLayout</a> that positions each node in the lane in which it is supposed to be.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed parts that have their location or position set when not in the Diagram.
    This issue affected temporary parts, such as Adornments created by Tools that were repeatedly added and removed from the Diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed ordering of links on a <a>Spot,TopSide</a> or <a>Spot,BottomSide</a> port when linking with a node to the right.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed some scaling animations when <a>Diagram.autoScale</a> is set.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.20">Changes for 2.1.20</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>GraphLinksModel.setLabelKeysForLinkData</a> sometimes disassociating a link's label nodes that existed in both the old and new array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the recording of model changes bound to a Part's <code>position</code> or <code>location</code>, where they may not have been recorded
    in the UndoManager when modifying the <code>position</code>, <code>location</code>, or <code>desiredSize</code>.
    This also fixes a regression from 2.1.14.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>LinearGradient</a> painting when used as a <a>Shape.stroke</a>.
    This drawing issue was most apparent when the Shape's geometry was one-dimensional.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed warning messages in Chrome about passive touch event listeners.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed JumpOver and AvoidsNodes issues where ongoing animations might stop them from updating.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.19">Changes for 2.1.19</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed changing <a>Placeholder.padding</a> to remeasure its <a>Group</a> or <a>Adornment</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.initialPosition</a> and <a>Diagram.initialScale</a> sometimes not showing scrollbars on initialization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed not recording a transaction that was empty until a "CommittingTransaction" Transaction-type <a>ChangedEvent</a>
    caused some <a>ChangedEvent</a>s to made, a regression from 2.1.16.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.18">Changes for 2.1.18</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/belts.html">Belts and Rollers</a> sample,
    showing belts or chains wending around rollers or gears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed finding a node by key after undoing a call to <a>Model.setKeyForNodeData</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed Diagram initialization without DIVs or with delayed initialization,
    where setting some properties like <a>Diagram.scaleComputation</a> would cause measuring errors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved handling of numeric large arc flag values when creating SVG arc <a>PathSegment</a>s via <a>PathSegment.constructor</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the TypeScript declaration for <a>GraphObject,make</a> to handle <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.17">Changes for 2.1.17</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/radialAdornment.html">Radial Adornment Buttons</a> sample,
    showing a selection <a>Adornment</a>, only on one node, that is like a context menu
    with buttons arranged in a circle around the selected node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/donutCharts.html">Donut Charts</a> sample,
    showing a simple circular bar chart in each node.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed exporting the <a>Picture.reloadSource</a> and <a>Picture.redraw</a> methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the <a>LinkingBaseTool.temporaryFromPort</a> and <a>LinkingBaseTool.temporaryToPort</a> property setters
    to replace the port of the corresponding temporary node.  This allows customization of a <a>LinkingTool</a>
    by setting either or both of those two properties.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.makeImage</a> with a Picture SVG data URI source, in the same manner as in 2.1.16.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed undo of a <a>Shape.geometry</a> setting, after its <a>GraphObject.desiredSize</a> had been set.
    This particular sequence of events was discovered in the use of the <a>GeometryReshapingTool</a> extension.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.16">Changes for 2.1.16</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/animatedFocus.html">Animated Focus</a> sample,
    which demonstrates how to scroll to a node and really make it obvious where the node is
    and what it looks like.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/addToPalette.html">Add To Palette</a> sample,
    which allows the user to add items from the palette by selecting a node,
    customizing it, and then executing a command to copy it to the palette's model.
    The user can also remove selected items from the palette via a command,
    even though <a>Palette.isReadOnly</a> is true.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.makeImage</a> when a Picture has an SVG source that has a different size than its viewbox.
    In some browsers the SVGs had been drawn with the incorrect aspect ratio.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.delayInitialization</a> incorrectly resetting the <a>Diagram.position</a> when animation is enabled.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.15">Changes for 2.1.15</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/singlePage.html">Single Page Diagram</a> sample,
    demonstrating how to show a sheet of paper behind the diagram and how to limit
    dragging and resizing to stay within the margins of the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed label TextBlocks in <a href="intro/graduatedPanels.html">Graduated Panels</a> not respecting their assigned <a>GraphObject.angle</a>.
    The angle will now be used when the label's <a>GraphObject.segmentOrientation</a> is <a>Link.None</a>, <a>Link.OrientAlong</a>,
    or <a>Link.OrientUpright</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed expand and collapse animations, where collapsed objects would temporarily receive NaN locations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.14">Changes for 2.1.14</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/blockEditor.html">Simple Block Editor</a> sample,
    demonstrating how to let users easily build block diagrams.
  </li>
  <li>
    Changing <a>Link.fromShortLength</a> or <a>Link.toShortLength</a> no longer invalidates the link's route.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the corner curves of orthogonal links when needing to make consecutive turns within double the corner radius.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed an incorrect optimization introduced in 2.1.13 updating initial scrollbars when animating.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed undo and redo of <a>ResizingTool</a> operations when the <a>Part.locationSpot</a> is not TopLeft.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.13">Changes for 2.1.13</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed the cursor shown during a drag in an <a>Overview</a> if some external HTML element changed the cursor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.makeSvg</a> when rendering a fill or a stroke that is translucent not to make the opacity too small.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added wait spinners to three of the "Virtualized" samples:
    <a href="samples/virtualized.html" target="_blank">Virtualized</a>,
    <a href="samples/virtualizedForceLayout.html" target="_blank">VirtualizedForceDirectedLayout</a>,
    <a href="samples/virtualizedTreeLayout.html" target="_blank">VirtualizedTreeLayout</a>.
    These use an image rotated using CSS animation that is positioned in front of the Diagram.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.12">Changes for 2.1.12</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/controlGauges.html">Meter and Gauge Controls</a> sample,
    demonstrating several different kinds of meter and gauge instruments whose values
    can also be modified by the user by dragging their indicators.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/productionEditor.html">Production process editor</a> sample,
    which edits diagrams that can be shown by the
    <a href="samples/productionProcess.html">Production process</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added the <a>SnapLinkReshapingTool.avoidsNodes</a> property in the extensions directories.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.11">Changes for 2.1.11</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed "Grid" Panels to ignore the order of shapes in the panel when considering whether a larger <a>Shape.interval</a>
    shape should suppress a smaller interval shape, or should be suppressed by a larger interval shape.
    Changed "Grid" Panels to allow multiple shapes with the same <a>Shape.interval</a> to be drawn in the same orientation
    (horizontal or vertical).
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed documentation by undocumenting the useless <a>AnimationManager.animationReasons</a> property that was accidentally documented.
    See the updated documentation for <a>AnimationManager.canStart</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Brush.isDark</a> sometimes using an incorrect ordering of <a>Brush.colorStops</a>
    when determining darkness near the middle of a Brush.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.10">Changes for 2.1.10</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a>DrawCommandHandler.pullToFront</a> and <a>DrawCommandHandler.pushToBack</a> commands in the extensions directories.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.9">Changes for 2.1.9</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed breadth computations for some cases of <a>TreeLayout.arrangement</a> of separate trees
    when <a>TreeLayout.compaction</a> is <code>go.TreeLayout.CompactionNone</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed type declarations of <a>Binding.converter</a> and <a>Binding.backConverter</a>
    to return <code>any</code> instead of <code>void</code>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.8">Changes for 2.1.8</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="samples/gameOfLife.html">Game of Life cellular automation</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can improve the performance of an <a>Overview</a> that is observing a large diagram with a visible <a>Diagram.grid</a>
    by setting <a>Overview.drawsTemporaryLayers</a> to false.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the behavior from 2.1.7 when trying to open text editors in multiple diagrams.
    A new text editor can be started only if the previous one was able to be accepted.
    If <a>TextBlock.textValidation</a> or <a>TextEditingTool.textValidation</a> fails,
    focus remains in that older editor and a new one cannot be started.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed exception during copy-dragging when some parts are not <a>Part.copyable</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.7">Changes for 2.1.7</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added the <a href="extensionsJSM/PackedHierarchy.html">Packed Hierarchy</a> sample,
    which demonstrates a custom <a>PackedLayout</a> for nested circular groups.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added an optional argument to <a>Diagram.clearSelection</a>, and allowed that method to be overridden.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a>TextEditingTool</a> now only allows one active text editor globally, instead of one per Diagram.
    This avoids some focus problems in various browsers.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.6">Changes for 2.1.6</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The <code>release/go-module.js</code> file now exports every class, so that you can import only specific classes, instead of <code>go</code>.
    For example: <code>import { Diagram, Node, Link, Point, Shape, TextBlock } from ...</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added a sample demonstrating generating a PDF file for a Diagram, in the <code>projects/pdf</code> subdirectory.
    The sample is at <a href="projects/pdf/minimalPDF.html" target="_blank">minimalPDF</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s erroneously starting when dragging and dropping Parts from another Diagram or Palette.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>LinkingTool</a> not deselecting other parts when a new link is created.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.5">Changes for 2.1.5</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a href="extensionsJSM/VirtualizedPacked.html">VirtualizedPacked</a> sample,
    which demonstrates a custom layout for large graphs of nested groups,
    defined in <a href="extensionsJSM/VirtualizedPackedLayout.ts">VirtualizedPackedLayout.ts</a>.
    (Source is TS only)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed setting a node key reference in either a node or link via <a>GraphLinksModel.setGroupKeyForNodeData</a>,
    <a>GraphLinksModel.setFromKeyForLinkData</a>, or <a>GraphLinksModel.setToKeyForLinkData</a> where it could fail to resolve
    if the node did not yet exist. This issue did not exist during typical model loading.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression since 2.1.1 with <a>Diagram.clear</a> failing to clear internal Parts lists (like <a>Diagram.nodes</a>).
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.4">Changes for 2.1.4</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a>Link.computeAdjusting</a> to conditionally change the value of <a>Link.adjusting</a> used. As a new default,
    links will use the adjusting value <a>Link,End</a> during animation. <a>Link.computeAdjusting</a> can be overridden to change this behavior.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added <a>Geometry.getPointAlongPath</a>, <a>Geometry.getAngleAlongPath</a>, and <a>Geometry.getFractionForPoint</a>.
    These methods can be used to find a point or angle for a given fractional distance along a Geometry's path,
    or to find the fractional distance along the Geometry's path given a nearby point.
  </li>
  <li>
    Setting <a>GraphObject.segmentIndex</a> to NaN, which was previously an error,
    will now treat the entire link path as the segment for the purpose of <a>GraphObject.segmentFraction</a>.
    This allows for using fractional distances along the entire link rather than just one segment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed object picking during Diagram's InitialLayoutCompleted DiagramEvent.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed GoCloudStorage where a null defaultModel would fail.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Panel.graduatedValueForPoint</a> in cases where the main shape was a diagonal line
    and the provided point didn't fall on the line.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.3">Changes for 2.1.3</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression from 2.0.0 with AvoidsNodes links improperly re-routing when using the DraggingTool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a undo (redo) bug with <a>AnimationTrigger</a>s that used location or position on Parts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved routing of duplicate links that have <a>Link.adjusting</a> set to a value other than None and have
    more than the standard number of points in their route.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.2">Changes for 2.1.2</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed a regression in 2.1.1 with the timing of <code>InitialAnimationStarting</code> that would prevent custom
    initial animations.
  </li>
  <li>
    CTRL + Mouse-wheel will still stop the event from bubbling,
    even if <a>CommandHandler.canIncreaseZoom</a> or <a>CommandHandler.canDecreaseZoom</a> return false.
    These are potentially false if a <a>Diagram.minScale</a> or <a>Diagram.maxScale</a> are set.
    This change stops the entire page from accidentally zooming during a zoom-wheel operation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed a measuring bug with Link Geometry when the Link is smaller than the <a>Link.toShortLength</a> or <a>Link.fromShortLength</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.1">Changes for 2.1.1</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed updating of <a>Adornment</a>s when there are <a>Binding</a>s from <a>Model.modelData</a>
    and that shared object has been modified by calling <a>Model.set</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved performance when replacing <a>Diagram.model</a> when cleaning up the old model,
    which had infrequently resulted in obscure warnings in debug mode about <a>Node.isTreeLeaf</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixes for loading Models with serialized EnumValues.
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance improvements for concurrent animations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixes for consistency of animation state.
    This includes modifying when <code>AnimationStarting</code> and <code>InitialAnimationStarting</code> are
    called,
    and fixes when default animations are stopped and another is immediately started, such as when loading a new
    model in the middle of animation.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Model.fromJson</a> loading models with serialized EnumValues.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved showing non-default cursors when dragging between diagrams.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed the operation of <a>Diagram.handlesDragDropForTopLevelParts</a> when dragging on the elements of a <a>Group</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed <a>Diagram.scrollHorizontalLineChange</a> and <a>Diagram.scrollVerticalLineChange</a> would
    not affect scrolling size in some browsers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed AvoidsNodes Links routing in nested groups.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="2.1.0">Other Changes for 2.1.0:</h4>
<p>
  See the major changes <a href="#2.1">above</a>.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Added <a>DoubleTreeLayout</a> to the extensions and extensionsJSM directories. This is now used by the
    <a href="samples/doubleTree.html">Double Tree</a> sample.
  </li>
  <li>
    Updated the sequencing of "ChangingSelection" and "ChangedSelection" <a>DiagramEvent</a>s to be outside of
    transactions for commands and tools.
    Exceptions include "ChangingSelection" being called during "Drag" and "Linking" operations when drag-copying or
    inserting a link.
    With "ChangedSelection" occuring after a transaction completes, any changes will be complete and can be used in
    the listener.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>CommandHandler.zoomToFit</a> now animates by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    Improved the <a>ContextMenuTool.defaultTouchContextMenu</a>'s "Paste" command to use the <a>ContextMenuTool.mouseDownPoint</a>
    rather than the <a>Diagram.lastInput</a>'s <a>InputEvent.documentPoint</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added new property, <a>Diagram.opacity</a>. This may be useful for fade-in/out animations, or visual indication
    of a disabled Diagram.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added new method, <a>Diagram.findLinkForKey</a>, which will look for a link corresponding to a model's link
    data object's unique key.
    This will only return a link when using a <a>GraphLinksModel</a> with <a>GraphLinksModel.linkKeyProperty</a>
    set to a non-empty string.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a>Model.applyIncrementalJson</a> now throws an error if model properties (eg. nodeKeyProperty) included in the
    JSON don't match the existing model.
    This check only includes properties included in the output from <a>Model.toIncrementalJson</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added new methods, <a>Picture.reloadSource</a>, which reloads a Picture source in case the file on the server has
    changed,
    and <a>Picture.redraw</a> which redraws the picture, and can be useful to update the Picture if the source is
    backed by an HTML Canvas or HTML Video Element.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added new sample: <a href="samples/svgDataUrl.html" target="_blank">SVG Data URL</a> - Export SVG with Base64 hrefs instead
    of the <a>Picture.source</a> URL.
  </li>
</ul>
